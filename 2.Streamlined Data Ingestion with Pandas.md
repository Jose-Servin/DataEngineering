# Course: Streamlined Data Ingestion with Pandas

## Flat Files

Most common "human" made file (.csv). Follows the one row per line format where values are separated by a delimiter.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('path/to/file.csv')

```

For tab separated, or any other type of delimiter, we simply use the `sep` argument.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('path/to/file.csv', sep="\t")
```

## Modifying Flat File Imports

When using `df.shape()` we get back `(rows, column)`. If we want to limit this import, we can use the `usecols` argument when reading in the data and providing `columns` which can either be names or column numbers.

We can also limit the number of rows by using the `nrows` argument and providing the max integer value for our max number of rows. This can be confirmed with a `df.shape` call.

To grab "middle data" from a `df` we can use the `nrows` and `skiprows` arguments to access this middle chunk.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('path/to.file.csv',
    nrows = 500,
    skiprows = 1000,
    headers = None
)
```

Here, we set `header=None` because we are skipping the headers and by default Pandas treats the first row as the headers for our data.

Lastly, to assign column names we use the `names` argument which takes in a list of names to use. If we want to copy from a long list of column names we can use the `columns  = list(df.columns)` and pass this to the `names=columns` argument.

## Handling Errors and Missing Data

The default behavior of Pandas is to infer the data types of columns. However, this can sometimes be wrong. We can see what data types were assigned using `print(df.dtypes)`.

During import, we can specify all or single column data types using the `dtype` argument which takes a dictionary using `column_name:data_type`.

```python
df = pd.read_csv(....,dtype = {'zip_code':str})`
```

To handle missing data, we can specify what column values should be NA using the `na_values` argument.

```python
df = pd.read_csv(....,na_values = {'zip_code':0})`
```

Here, we are saying "fill all 0 values from the zip_code column with NA".

Lastly, to handle error lines during import we can catch exception using `error_bad_lines` and `warn_bad_lines` arguments.

* `error_bad_lines = False` means Pandas will skip unparsable lines.
* `warn_bad_lines = True` means messages will be displayed when records are skipped.
